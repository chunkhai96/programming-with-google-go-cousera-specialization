- As the density of transistor increasing, the power consumption also increasing
- The temperature also increase as the power consumption increase
- Besides, there are also limitation in voltage scaling
- Voltage scaling cannot prevent leakage and cause power loss
- Voltage noise also make voltage scaling more difficult
